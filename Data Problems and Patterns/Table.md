In general, the pattern should be:

1) Identify the problem (exists)
2) Apply a Pattern to fix the problem

So, in the tool (like R), for each problem show the learner "the code" for how to identify the problem and apply the pattern.

# Problems
## Patterns


# Invalid Identifier (Bad Primary Key)
1) Identify
* Missing
* Duplicated

### 1) Create Primary Key Column

### 2) Combine Two or More Columns



# Redundant Columns

1) Identify
	* Look for overlapping data  (Area Code and Phone Number -- where phone number has area code)
	* Look for dependencies (age is dependent birthdate)



## Extracting parts of a column


## Combining multiple columns
