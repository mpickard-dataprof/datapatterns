# recipes package

## Basic recipe terms
* `prep()` - train the model. That is, apply a series of steps to the training set (similar to sklearn's `fit()`)
* `bake()` - apply the model. That is, transform a new (test) dataset using the exact same steps as were performed on the training set (similar to sklearn's `predict()`)
* `juice()` - extract the processed training set from the recipe as a dataframe
